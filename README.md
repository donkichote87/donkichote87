- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kamil
- ðŸŒ± I've completed Junior Java Developer course in 2021 and I've started my career as freshly baked professional Java Developer.
- âœ¨ Other than learning IT in my free time I also love to play board games, reading fantasy books or some superhero comics. Basically nerdy stuff ;)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on commercial projects to gain more business experience.
